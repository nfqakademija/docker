How to deploy project
=====================

If [configured correctly](how-to-create-new-project.md), you only need to **`git push origin master`**.

Jenkins in `ci.nfqakademija.lt` will run:
```bash
$WORKSPACE/.deploy/build.sh
echo "[app]
nfqakademija.lt ansible_host=deploy.nfqakademija.lt ansible_user=$JOB_NAME
" > $WORKSPACE/.deploy/ansible_hosts
$WORKSPACE/.deploy/deploy.sh
```

And your page will appear in http://PROJECT_NAME.projektai.nfqakademija.lt/,
where `PROJECT_NAME` is usually the same as the name of github repository.

## How deployment works

![How deployment works](res/scheme-deploy-overview.png)

1. You merge your changes to `master` branch and push it to GitHub (`git push origin master`)
2. [GitHub](https://github.com/) have WebHook configured for the project, so it informs `ci.nfqakademija.lt`,
   that new changes are pushed to repository
   (this is optional step just make deployment faster and easier)
3. [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) checks if it have triggers enabled and branch is `master` â€“ if all ok,
   Jenkins starts new job.
   Meaning, it executes `build.sh`, generates `ansible_hosts` file and executes `deploy.sh`.
   (you can trigger build manually by logging in to `ci.nfqakademija.lt` and pushing `Build Now`)
4. [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) (started by `deploy.sh`) use configuration in `deploy_playbook.yaml`.
   Usually it SSH to Web Server, copies build artifacts (E.g. `project.tar.gz`), change symbolic links to newest version
   (to make deployment atomic), warm-up cache.
5. If there are no errors, you should see your new changes via `http://PROJECT_NAME.projektai.nfqakademija.lt/`,
   where `PROJECT_NAME` is your GitHub repository name.
6. For more complex scenarios (E.g. custom `.env` configuration, setting up database tables),
   you can connect to WEB server using `ssh PROJECT_NAME@deploy.nfqakademija.lt -p 2222`,
   where `PROJECT_NAME` is your GitHub repository name.
7. If there are any errors, you can login to [ci.nfqakademija.lt](https://ci.nfqakademija.lt/) and in `Build History`
   check `Console Output`.
   Last lines usually shows error message.
   Whole output is generated by `build.sh` and `deploy.sh` commands.
   (E.g. you can see `+ composer install --no-dev --no-scripts --no-interaction --optimize-autoloader` command).

To get notifications about failed/successful builds, you can add `Jenkins` integration to `Slack`

## How to update database on server

1. SSH to deploy server:
```bash
ssh PROEJCT_NAME@deploy.nfqakademija.lt -p 2222
```
Where `PROEJCT_NAME` is your GitHub repository name

2. Go to current deployed version
```bash
cd ~/current
```
3. Use `bin/console` as you did locally (database credentials already in `.env`, which is linked to `~/shared/.env`):
```bash
bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```
Answer `Yes` (assuming you are the author and know, what migrations are to be applied)
